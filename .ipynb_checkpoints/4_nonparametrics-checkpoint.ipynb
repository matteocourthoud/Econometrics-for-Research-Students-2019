The optimal rate for estimation of $g(x)$ is $K = O(n^{\\frac{1}{1+ 2\\alpha}})$. If we set $K = n^{\\frac{1}{1+ 2\\alpha}}$ by this rule then $n K^{-2\\alpha} = n^{\\frac{1}{1+ 2\\alpha}} \\to \\infty$ not zero. Thus this assumption is equivalent to assuming that $K$ is much larger than optimal. The reason why this trick works (that is, why the bias is negligible) is that by increasing $K$ the asymptotic bias decreases and the asymptotic variance increases and thus the variance dominates. Because $K$ is larger than optimal, we typically say that $\\hat{g}(x)$ is **undersmoothed** relative to the optimal series estimator.\n",

    "- Second, the assumption $\\sqrt{n} K^{-\\alpha} = o(1)$ does not eliminate the asymptotic bias, it only makes it of lower order than the variance. So the approximation of the theorem is technically valid, but the missing asymptotic bias term is just slightly smaller in asymptotic order, and thus still relevant in finite samples. \n",
    "- Third, the condition $\\sqrt{n} K^{\\alpha} = o(1)$ is just an assumption, it has nothing to do with actual empirical practice. Thus the difference between the two theorems is in the assumptions, not in the actual reality or in the actual empirical practice. Eliminating a nuisance (the asymptotic bias) through an assumption is a trick, not a substantive use of theory. My strong view is that the result (1) is more informative than (2). It shows that the asymptotic distribution is normal but has a non-trivial finite sample bias."

    "Hansen (2019): in this and the previous chapter we have presented two distinct methods of nonparametric regression based on kernel methods and series methods. Which should be used in practice? Both methods have advantages and disadvantages and there is no clear overall winner.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, while the asymptotic theory of the two estimators appear quite different, they are actually rather closely related. When the regression function $g(x)$ is twice differentiable $(s = 2)$ then the rate of convergence of both the MSE of the kernel regression estimator with optimal bandwidth $h$ and the series estimator with optimal $K$ is $n^{-\\frac{2}{k+4}}$ (where $k = \\dim(x)$).  There is no difference. If the regression function is smoother than twice differentiable ($s > 2$) then the rate of the convergence of the series estimator improves. This may appear to be an advantage for series methods, but kernel regression can also take advantage of the higher smoothness by using so-called higher-order kernels or local polynomial regression, so perhaps this advantage is not too large.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both estimators are asymptotically normal and have straightforward asymptotic standard error formulae. The series estimators are a bit more convenient for this purpose, as classic parametric standard error formula work without amendment.\n",
    "\n",
    "An advantage of kernel methods is that their distributional theory is easier to derive. The theory is all based on local averages which is relatively straightforward. In contrast, series theory is more challenging, dealing with increasing parameter spaces. An important difference in the theory is that for kernel estimators we have explicit representations for the bias while we only have rates for series methods. This means that plug-in methods can be used for bandwidth selection in kernel regression. However, typically we rely on cross-validation, which is equally applicable in both kernel and series regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "Kernel methods are also relatively easy to implement when the dimension of $x$, $k$, is large. There is not a major change in the methodology as $k$ increases. In contrast, series methods become quite cumbersome as $k$ increases as the number of cross-terms increases exponentially. E.g ($K=2$) with $k=1$ you have only $\\{x_1, x_1^2\\}$; with $k=2$ you have to add $\\{x_2, x_2^2, x_1 x_2 \\}$; with $k=3$ you have to add $\\{x_3, x_3^2, x_1 x_3, x_2 x_3\\}$, etc..\n",
    "\n",
    "A major advantage of series methods is that it has inherently a high degree of flexibility, and the user is able to implement shape restrictions quite easily. For example, in series estimation it is relatively simple to implement a partial linear CEF, an additively separable CEF, monotonicity, concavity or convexity. These restrictions are harder to implement in kernel regression."
